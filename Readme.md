# COVID-19 X-ray Image Generation using GANs

## Project Overview
This project utilizes a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to generate synthetic X-ray images for COVID-19, Lung Opacity, Normal, and Viral Pneumonia cases. The dataset used is the **COVID-19 Radiography Dataset**, and the model is built using TensorFlow and Keras.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of X-ray images categorized into four classes:
- **COVID**
- **Lung Opacity**
- **Normal**
- **Viral Pneumonia**

The images are preprocessed and resized to **128x128 pixels** before training the model.

## Dependencies
To run this project, install the required dependencies:
```sh
pip install tensorflow numpy matplotlib
```

## Model Architecture
### Generator
The generator is a deep neural network that takes a **100-dimensional random noise vector** as input and generates a **128x128 grayscale image** using transposed convolution layers.

### Discriminator
The discriminator is a convolutional neural network that classifies images as either real (from dataset) or fake (generated by the generator). It consists of multiple convolutional layers with **LeakyReLU** activation and dropout for regularization.

### GAN (Generative Adversarial Network)
The GAN combines the generator and discriminator into a single model. The generator tries to fool the discriminator, while the discriminator learns to distinguish between real and fake images.

## Training
Run the following command to start training:
```sh
python main.py
```
The model is trained for **5000 epochs** with a batch size of **32**.

## Output
During training, images are generated and saved in the `generated_images/` folder at every **250 epochs**. The training process prints the discriminator and generator losses for monitoring.

## Future Improvements
- Improve image resolution (e.g., **256x256** instead of **128x128**).
- Experiment with different GAN architectures such as **DCGAN** or **WGAN**.
- Fine-tune hyperparameters for better performance.
